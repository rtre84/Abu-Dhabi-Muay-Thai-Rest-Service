To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### To test the graphql endpoint (assuming migrations have been run)

Send a GET request to the below url in your tool of choice.  
`localhost:4000/api_graphql/test?query={user {id,email,active}}`

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
